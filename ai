# AI Chatbot for Waste Segregation – Project README

## Overview
An AI-powered chatbot built to improve waste segregation practices in a residential community. It combines NLP preprocessing, machine learning, and retrainable model design to provide accurate, adaptable responses. This project supports sustainable development goals and civic awareness while demonstrating responsible and transparent AI behavior.

---

## Core Capabilities
- Retrainable model wrapper with support for incremental learning
- Multi-model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes
- Built-in k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation
- Confidence-based predictions for user interaction
- Model configuration and persistence with joblib

---

## NLP Preprocessing (using `nltk`, `re`)
- Text cleaning with regex
- Tokenization and stopword removal
- Stemming and lemmatization
- URL and special character removal

---

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression – Fast, interpretable
- Random Forest – Ensemble-based, robust
- SVM – Suitable for complex patterns
- Naive Bayes – Probabilistic with incremental learning

---

## Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Count Vectorization
- N-gram support (unigrams and bigrams)

---

## Data Management (using `pandas`, `json`)
- Session logging and performance tracking
- Configurable retraining and model updates
- Model persistence with joblib

---

## Ethical & Social Impact
This chatbot was developed as part of the Green Warriors initiative and deployed across a 400+ household community. It helps promote environmentally responsible behavior using ethical and transparent AI systems. Key goals include accessibility, explainability, and AI for civic empowerment.

---

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Run `train.py` to train or retrain the model
3. Start the chatbot with `main.py`

# SOP Snippet (for NTU – AI and Society)

I developed an AI-powered chatbot to promote waste segregation in a 400+ household community. Using NLP and multiple ML models, I built a retrainable system that adapts to new user data and tracks its performance. The project reflects my commitment to responsible, accessible, and civic-centered AI – values central to NTU’s AI and Society program.
