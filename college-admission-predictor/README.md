# College Admission Predictor – Full-Stack ML Project

## 🔍 Overview
The **College Admission Predictor** is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to estimate a student’s likelihood of admission to various college tiers based on academic, extracurricular, and socio-demographic features. Built using Python, it demonstrates a complete data science pipeline — from synthetic data generation and model building to bias analysis and ethical reflection — aligning with the real-world standards of responsible AI.

## 📘 Project Narrative: How I Built a Fair and Explainable College Admission Predictor Using AI

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my full-stack ML project — the **College Admission Predictor** — where I explore how machine learning can be used not only for prediction, but also for fairness, explainability, and social responsibility.

This project was built as part of my preparation for NTU's B.Sc. (Hons) in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI), combining technical proficiency with ethical AI design — core values of the program.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate college admissions and predict the likelihood of acceptance using academic, extracurricular, and socio-demographic data. Using a synthetic dataset of 5,000 student profiles, I built a complete data pipeline that addresses:

- Accurate predictions using ML models
- Transparent and interpretable outputs
- Ethical evaluation through bias and fairness analysis

## 🧭 Why This Project Matters

In an age where AI influences critical decisions like college admissions, it's essential that these systems are not just *accurate*, but also *accountable*. This project reflects how machine learning can be applied to socially relevant domains like education — ensuring the models we build do not unintentionally perpetuate bias or inequity.

## 🎯 Alignment with NTU DSAI

The DSAI program at NTU emphasizes real-world impact, interdisciplinary AI, and responsible data practices — all of which are embedded in this project. I hope to continue this journey by learning how to build AI systems that are impactful, explainable, and fair.
