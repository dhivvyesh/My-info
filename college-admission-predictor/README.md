# College Admission Predictor – Full-Stack ML Project

## 🔍 Overview
The **College Admission Predictor** is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to estimate a student’s likelihood of admission to various college tiers based on academic, extracurricular, and socio-demographic features. Built using Python, it demonstrates a complete data science pipeline — from synthetic data generation and model building to bias analysis and ethical reflection — aligning with the real-world standards of responsible AI.

## 🚀 Features
- Simulates real-world admission scenarios using a synthetic dataset of 5,000 student profiles
- Implements multiple ML models: **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **Gradient Boosting**, **Support Vector Machines**
- Uses **SMOTE** for class imbalance correction
- Performs **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluates performance with **ROC-AUC**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **Classification Reports**
- Applies **Permutation Importance** and **SHAP** for explainability
- Analyzes fairness by **parental education**, **school type**, and **income quintile**
- Provides visualizations for feature impact, bias, and prediction confidence
