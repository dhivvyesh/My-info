## Projects

### Research Paper – Why and How Do Hackers Hack
I authored a research paper analyzing hacker motivations, cyber risks, and how AI systems can be misused if not governed responsibly. This work helped me understand the importance of digital ethics, cybersecurity, and AI governance. With a plagiarism score of just 0.7%, the paper reflects my commitment to original thought and policy-focused inquiry.

### Railway Management System
A Python and SQL-based CLI project simulating a real-world railway booking system. It includes modules for seat allocation, fare computation, and live input validation. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of logic-building, structured data handling, and database interaction. It laid the groundwork for thinking critically about real-world system applications.

### College Admission Calculator
The College Admission Calculator is a machine learning project that predicts a student's chance of admission using classification models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and ROC-AUC. Visualizations are created with Matplotlib to interpret results and feature importance. This project demonstrates the practical use of data science in education, highlighting the role of responsible and explainable AI in socially relevant domains.

# Why I Chose NTU's B.Sc (Hons) in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)

## Personal Motivation
My passion for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence stems from a desire to solve real-world problems using structured, interpretable data and ethical modeling. I have developed projects such as a College Admission Predictor using logistic regression and Random Forest, as well as a Python-SQL Railway Management System simulating real-time operations. These experiences allowed me to build core skills in model evaluation, data visualization, and system logic, while also introducing me to fairness, bias, and ethical data usage.

## Why NTU
NTU stands out for its robust data science curriculum, industry partnerships, and interdisciplinary research ecosystem. The DSAI program offers a comprehensive foundation in machine learning, statistical modeling, and applied AI, all of which directly align with my academic and career goals. Its focus on innovation through responsible data-driven systems strongly appeals to my interest in socially impactful AI.

## Why Assoc Prof Sourav Saha Bhowmick
I am especially inspired by Assoc Prof Sourav Saha Bhowmick, who leads the Data Management and Analytics Research Group (DANTE). His work in data modeling and multi-domain applications—including biomedical and societal data—mirrors my goal to use AI in service of communities and institutions. Learning from his research group would give me both the mentorship and environment needed to contribute meaningfully to data-driven innovation.

## Long-Term Vision
Through NTU’s DSAI program, I aim to master predictive modeling, data analysis, and ethical AI. I intend to apply these skills to sectors like education analytics, civic systems, and public decision-making platforms. NTU’s global reputation and research leadership offer the ideal launchpad to achieve these goals and build technology that is impactful, explainable, and fair.
