## Projects

### Research Paper – Why and How Do Hackers Hack
I authored a research paper analyzing hacker motivations, cyber risks, and how AI systems can be misused if not governed responsibly. This work helped me understand the importance of digital ethics, cybersecurity, and AI governance. With a plagiarism score of just 0.7%, the paper reflects my commitment to original thought and policy-focused inquiry.

### Railway Management System
A Python and SQL-based CLI project simulating a real-world railway booking system. It includes modules for seat allocation, fare computation, and live input validation. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of logic-building, structured data handling, and database interaction. It laid the groundwork for thinking critically about real-world system applications.

### Warrior AI – Ethical Waste Management Chatbot
A machine learning–driven chatbot developed as part of the Green Warriors initiative to assist over 400 households in waste segregation. The system uses NLP (tokenization, lemmatization), TF-IDF, and classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes. It is retrainable, ethical, and civic-minded—built to demonstrate how AI can reinforce public good and sustainable behavior. This project helped me learn model design, bias mitigation, and explainable AI techniques.

## Why NTU – B.Comp in Artificial Intelligence and Society
NTU’s AI and Society program aligns deeply with my goal of using AI for sustainable, transparent, and social impact. I am particularly drawn to modules such as “AI for Social Good” and “Ethics and Governance in Technology,” as well as the interdisciplinary focus on humanities and design.

Faculty like **Prof. Bo An**, whose work on AI planning and game theory in multi-agent systems, resonates with my interest in community-level decision-making AI. The program’s emphasis on responsible innovation and societal relevance makes it an ideal match for my learning style and career vision.

Compared to other programs, NTU uniquely integrates AI ethics, social governance, and public good, which mirrors the intent behind projects like Warrior AI. This is why I believe NTU is the best platform to evolve my technical capabilities alongside moral responsibility.
