# Hi, I’m Dhivvyesh Kumar
 
Aspiring AI innovator passionate about ethical, human-centered technology  
Co-founder of Green Warriors | 📸 School Photographer |AI Ethics Researcher  
Applying to NTU – B.Comp in Artificial Intelligence and Society



## My Vision  
I believe AI should be designed with empathy, fairness, and transparency.  
My work blends technical skill with social impact — from building an admission prediction model  
that reflects on algorithmic bias to leading tree-planting initiatives for sustainability.  
NTU’s AI and Society program perfectly aligns with this interdisciplinary mindset.



## Featured Projects

### College Admission Calculator  
Built a machine learning model (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict college admissions.  
Included data visualization, hypothesis testing, and an ethical reflection on bias in AI decision-making.

### Railway Booking System  
Developed a Python-based CLI system for dynamic seat allocation, fare calculation, and real-time logic.  
Showcased structured programming, automation, and algorithm design.

### Research Paper: “Why and How Do Hackers Hack”  
Explored the psychology and ethics behind hacking.  
Connected findings to cybersecurity, digital misuse, and the importance of AI governance.
