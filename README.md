## Projects

### Research Paper – Why and How Do Hackers Hack
I authored a research paper analyzing hacker motivations, cyber risks, and how AI systems can be misused if not governed responsibly. This work helped me understand the importance of digital ethics, cybersecurity, and AI governance. With a plagiarism score of just 0.7%, the paper reflects my commitment to original thought and policy-focused inquiry.

### Railway Management System
A Python and SQL-based CLI project simulating a real-world railway booking system. It includes modules for seat allocation, fare computation, and live input validation. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of logic-building, structured data handling, and database interaction. It laid the groundwork for thinking critically about real-world system applications.

### College Admission Calculator
The College Admission Calculator is a machine learning project that predicts a student's chance of admission using classification models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and ROC-AUC. Visualizations are created with Matplotlib to interpret results and feature importance. This project demonstrates the practical use of data science in education, highlighting the role of responsible and explainable AI in socially relevant domains.
